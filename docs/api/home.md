## Creating A New Sequence

You can start a new Sequence by simply calling:
```js
new Sequence()
```
Any other methods you call on this will continue to work on the same sequence, like so:
```js
new Sequence()
     .thenDo(function(){
          console.log("I'm in here.")
     })
     .thenDo(function(){
          console.log("But now, I'm in here!")
     })
```

For module developers, by putting your module name in the Sequence like this:
```js
new Sequence({ moduleName: "myModuleName" })
```
Means that any errors will show up like this:

![Sequencer module error example](../images/error-example.jpg)

This will help you and your module's users to get to the bottom of the issue.

In addition, you can also add `softFail` like so:

```js
new Sequence({ moduleName: "myModuleName", softFail: true })
```

This will make sequencer consider all failures to find an effect file, sound file, or a macro a non-issue and simply continues executing the sequence, rather than halt the execution. 

## Core Methods

### Animation

`.animation()` or `.animation(inToken)` or `.animation(inTile)`

Creates an animation section. Until you call any of the [core methods](#sequencer-core-methods), you'll be working on the Animation section.

### Effect

`.effect()` or `.effect(inFile)`

Creates an effect section. Until you call any of the [core methods](#sequencer-core-methods), you'll be working on the Effect section.

### Sound

`.sound()` or `.sound(inFile)`

Creates a sound section. Until you call any of the [core methods](#sequencer-core-methods), you'll be working on the Sound section.

### Scrolling Text

`.scrollingText()` or `.scrollingText(inToken, inText, inTextStyles)`

Creates a scrolling text section. Until you call any of the [core methods](#sequencer-core-methods), you'll be working on the scrolling text section.

### Then do

```js
.thenDo(function(){
    //do Stuff
})
```

Creates a section that will run a function. Remember that if you want your function to be asynchronous, and you want it to properly wait, you'll want to make the function into an `async` function:

```js
.thenDo(async function(){
    //do Stuff
})
```

### Macro

`.macro("MacroName")` or `.macro(macroReference)`

Creates a section that will run a macro based on a name or a direct reference to a macro. If the macro is not found, Sequencer will complain. Loudly.

In Foundry v11, you can provide an object as a secondary parameter, which will be passed through to the macro:

`.macro("New Macro", { test: true, fileName: "fire-bolt", tokenId: token.id })`

In Foundry v10, if you have [Advanced Macros](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/advanced-macros) installed, you may also pass any number of parameters to the method that will then be passed through to the macro:

`.macro("New Macro", true, "fire-bolt", token.id)`

### Engagement

`.engagement()` or `.engagement("sounds/drums.wav")` or `.engagement("sounds/drums.wav", 5000)`

Causes the sequence to wait until every user has their browser focused on Foundry, with an optional sound to play for users whose browsers are not focused on Foundry, and an optional max wait time (in milliseconds).

### Wait

`.wait(1000)` or `.wait(500, 1000)`

Causes the sequence to wait after the last section for as many milliseconds as you pass to this method. If given a second number, a random wait time between the two given numbers will be generated.

### Add Sequence

`.addSequence(inSequence)`

Adds the sections from a given Sequence to this Sequence. This is useful if you have sequences you wish to combine at runtime.

### Play

`.play(inOptions)`

Returns `Promise`

Causes the Sequence to play through all of its sections. Returns a `Promise` which resolves when all sections have played.

Also supports an options object that accepts:
- `remote: boolean` - causes the sequence to be executed on each users' machine independently. This does not support `.animation()` sections when set to `true`
- `preload: boolean` - causes any section with `.file()` entries to preload all files that would be played
- `local: boolean` - causes sections to be played only locally to the user executing the sequence

### Preset

`.preset("name")`

Applies a preset to the sequence - read the [Sequencer Presets article](../presets.md) for more information.

Please note that some presets may require this to be called on an effect, sound, or animation section, rather than directly on the sequence.
