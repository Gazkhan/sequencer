### Global Reference

You can access any of the Helper functions through:

```js
Sequencer.Helpers;
```

### Wait

```js
await Sequencer.Helpers.wait(number);
```

Causes the code to wait for a given amount of milliseconds.

### Clamp

```js
Sequencer.Helpers.clamp(number, min, max);
```

Clamps a value between two numbers

### Interpolate

```js
Sequencer.Helpers.interpolate(p1, p2, t, ease);
```

This function interpolates between `p1` and `p2` based on a normalized value of `t`, determined by the `ease` provided (string or function, defaults to "linear").

You may provide a function for the `ease` parameter, which takes a single number and returns a single number.

### Random Float Between

```js
Sequencer.Helpers.random_float_between(min, max);
```

Returns a random floating point number between two given numbers.

### Random Integer Between

```js
Sequencer.Helpers.random_int_between(min, max);
```

Returns a random number between two given numbers.

### Shuffle Array

```js
Sequencer.Helpers.shuffle_array(array);
```

Returns a shuffled copy of the original array.

### Random Array Element

```js
Sequencer.Helpers.random_array_element(array, recurse);
```

Return a random element in the given array.

If `recurse` is set to `true`, if the chosen element is another array, it will continue into that array and pick a random element from that array, and so on.

### Random Object Element

```js
Sequencer.Helpers.random_object_element(object, recurse);
```

Return a random element in the given object.

If `recurse` is set to `true`, if the chosen element is another object or array, it will continue into that array and pick a random element from that object, and so on.

### Make Array Unique

```js
Sequencer.Helpers.make_array_unique(array);
```

Turns an array containing multiples of the same string, objects, etc, and removes duplications, and returns a fresh array.

### Wait For Engagement

```js
Sequencer.Helpers.waitForEngagement(inSrc, inMaxWaitTime);
```

Returns a promise that resolves when every user is focused on Foundry, with an optional sound to play for users who do not have their browsers focused on Foundry, and an optional max wait time.
